# Overivew
A collection of data, scripts, and analysis for [Protein stability is determined by single-site bias rather than pairwise covariance](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.09.632118).

Descriptions for each of the directories is as follows:

## plmDCA_asymmetric_v2_fit
Code for fitting the Potts model as described in the paper. Descriptions and instructions for running and analyzing the code are found in the README within the [directory](https://github.com/barricklab-at-jhu/Potts_analysis_Sternke_Tripp_Barrick/tree/main/plmDCA_asymmetric_v2_fit). 

## MSAs
Contains the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) used to fit the Potts model code in the `plmDCA_asymmetric_v2_fit` directory for all protein families examined in the paper. A description of generating and processing a MSA for a protein family is given in thhe README within the [directory](https://github.com/barricklab-at-jhu/Potts_analysis_Sternke_Tripp_Barrick/tree/main/MSAs).

## potts_fits_parameters
Resulting coefficients from the Potts model fits for protein families examined in the paper. 

## mc_sim_example
Example script, inputs, and outputs for optimizing sequences by the Potts energy functions using the Monte Carlo procedures as described in the paper. Instructions for running and analyzing the code are found in the README within the [directory](https://github.com/barricklab-at-jhu/Potts_analysis_Sternke_Tripp_Barrick/tree/main/mc_sim_example).
